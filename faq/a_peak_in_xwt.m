%% What does a peak in XWT mean?
% You have to be very careful interpreting XWT peaks. If you take the WTC
% of a signal with pure white noise then the XWT will look very similar to
% the WT of the signal. The same problem exists in 'normal' power spectral
% analysis. If you calculate the cross Power spectral density of a periodic
% signal with a white noise signal then you will get a peak. It does not
% mean that the series have any kind of connection just because there is a
% peak. I recommend examining the WTC and the phase arrows. If there is a
% connection then you would expect the phenomena to be phase-locked  degrees i.e.
% that the phase-arrows point only in one direction for a given wavelength.
% So, if they vary between in-phase and anti-phase then it is a clue that
% they probably not are linked.
